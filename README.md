# Wordle Game (Python Implementation)
This project is a Python implementation of the popular word puzzle game, Wordle. The game allows users to guess a hidden 5-letter word within six attempts, providing feedback on each guess.

## How the Game Works:
 The player has six attempts to guess a randomly chosen 5-letter word.
 After each guess, feedback is provided to indicate whether:
 A letter is in the correct position (highlighted in green).
 A letter is in the word but in the wrong position (highlighted in yellow).
 A letter is not in the word at all (highlighted in white).
 If the player guesses the word within six attempts, they win. Otherwise, they lose, and the correct word is revealed.
## How to Play:
 Run the game from the command line.
 Type your guess after the prompt.
 The game will show feedback on your guess, and you'll get 6 attempts to guess the secret word.
 After the game ends, you can either win (guess correctly) or lose (fail to guess within the attempts).

## Running the Game:
To play the game, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the necessary dependencies.
- Run the play_wordle.py script:
- python play_wordle.py
- Start guessing and enjoy the game!
